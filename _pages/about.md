Hi, this is Jintao Lu, PhD candidate at [HKUCG](https://hku-cg.github.io/), supervised by Prof. Taku Komura (https://hku-cg.github.io/author/taku-komura/). I received my Bachelor's degree on Automation at 2021 from Zhejiang university, specialize in Robotics at Chu Ko Chen Honorable Colledge.

My research is focus on the motion control/planning for virtual characters, especially when the manipulation is coupled with locomotion in life-like scenes.
